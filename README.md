# 🕵️‍♂️ Phishing URL Detector

A simple Python-based **Phishing URL Detector** that identifies suspicious URLs using rule-based checks.  
The tool analyzes URLs for common phishing indicators such as:  

- Use of IP address instead of domain  
- Presence of `@` symbol in URL  
- Excessive use of `-` in domain name  
- Lack of HTTPS  
- Very long URLs
